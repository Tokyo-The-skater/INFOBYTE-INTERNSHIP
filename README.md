## Tasks and Projects

### Task 1: Predicting Car Prices
- **Objective**: To develop a machine learning model to predict the price of cars based on various features such as mileage, engine size, and year of manufacture.
- **Tools and Technologies**: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib
- **Outcome**: Successfully developed and trained a regression model that achieved an accuracy of 90% in predicting car prices.

### Task 2: Predicting Three Different Types of Flowers
- **Objective**: To build a classification model to predict three different types of flowers (Rose, Tulip, Sunflower) based on their features such as petal length, petal width, and sepal length.
- **Tools and Technologies**: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib
- **Outcome**: Implemented a multi-class classification model using Random Forest algorithm with an accuracy of 95% in classifying flowers.

### Task 3: Data Analysis on India's Unemployment
- **Objective**: To perform data analysis on India's unemployment rates over the past decade and identify trends, patterns, and insights.
- **Tools and Technologies**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Outcome**: Conducted comprehensive data analysis, visualized key trends using line charts and heatmaps, and presented actionable insights to stakeholders.
